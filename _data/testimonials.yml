    I worked with Nic to completely re-design our organization's website and blog. She was a dream to work with, and always professional, communicated with me often, and responded to all my concerns and questions promptly. She was great at understanding my needs and talking me through the various options we had, as well as continually providing helpful advice and input... After the project's completion, she walked me through how to update the website and answered a few follow-up questions by email. Nic was a pleasure to work with and I'd recommend her to anyone wanting beautiful web work.
