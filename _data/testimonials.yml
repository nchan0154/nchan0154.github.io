    I worked with Nic to completely re-design our organization's website and blog. She was a dream to work with, and always professional, communicated with me often, and responded to all my concerns and questions promptly. She was great at understanding my needs and talking me through the various options we had, as well as continually providing helpful advice and input... After the project's completion, she walked me through how to update the website and answered a few follow-up questions by email. Nic was a pleasure to work with and I'd recommend her to anyone wanting beautiful web work.

    Nic helped me revamp my online illustration portfolio. As a non-techie myself, Nic was wonderful to work with. She is thorough and communicative, and did a great job showing me how to maintain the site or change my content. She also provides great suggestions for design, and codes with accessibility in mind, so that I know my website both looks great AND creates a seamless viewing experience for my audience.
