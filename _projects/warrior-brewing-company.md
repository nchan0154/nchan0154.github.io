blurb: A unique landing page for a veteran-owned brewery. 

solution: |
  Under <a href="http://www.wonderkiln.com">WonderKiln</a>, I executed the landing page for Warrior Brewing company and came up with the responsive version of the site. The heavy use of textures and imagery provided a unique challenge to making sure the site worked well on mobile. Extra care was taken to deliver the smallest file sizes possible without sacrificing the design.
