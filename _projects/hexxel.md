    As a part of <a href="http://wonderkiln.com">Wonderkiln</a>, I designed and implemented a quick yet responsive landing page for Hexxel to introduce their upcoming product. There are quite a few subtle animations not accurately conveyed in a static mockup, I encourage you to check out the page in it's full glory!
