brief: | 
    To put it gently, the Asian American Art Centre’s existing website was a mess. The navigation was confusing and inconsistent between pages, leading to a high bounce rate. Important content was buried deep in submenus, and dynamic content hadn’t been updated in years.
solution: |
    As the Arts Centre had shifted towards using social media to update its audience, I chose to build a responsive, mostly static site that focused on the major accomplishments in the organization’s history. I worked with the organization’s executive director to rewrite the content and designed several unique templates to fit the wide variety of content. The results of the redesign were immediate - the average pages per session and session length doubled and the bounce rate dropped from 70% to 40%.

        <p>The old June 4 exhibition microsite was a single large page, linked to on the old homepage with a banner graphic. The visual similarity to an ad graphic meant that very few people ever clicked on the page - it averaged 30 hits a month. Even worse, despite the density of content, people only spent an average of 40 seconds on the whole page. I restructured the content to create a more interactive online exhibition, designed to engage viewers more meaningfully. As a result, viewers now spend about 5 minutes on average browsing the the exhibition pages.</p>
