blurb: An easy to use shopping solution for a small business.

brief: | 
  Tag N’ Brag wanted to expand their e-commerce operations. Their existing shop, a small part of their main website, lacked the features they needed to expand and was cumbersome to update and maintain.
solution: |
  I worked with the talented designers at <a href="http://www.wonderkiln.com">WonderKiln</a> and expanded on existing desktop designs to come up with mobile designs and handled the complete integration into the Shopify platform. Built into the theme are featured homepage collections to show off particular products, a fully functional blog and an user account system.

    <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <h2 class="subheading">Fully Responsive</h2>
    <p>Having a website that adapts to all screen sizes is a top priority for most online retailers. Every page of the site was designed to provide an optimal user experience, no matter what the screen size.</p>
    <h2 class="subheading">Featured Collections</h2>
    <p>A custom feature I built for the site was the ability to feature collections on the homepage. Each collection is a draggable/swipeable slider within its own tab. The result is an optimized way to feature lots of products in a small amount of screen space.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading">Blog</h2>
    <p>Having an active blog can be a fantastic way to gain traffic. For TNB Apparel’s blog, I used CSS list columns to achieve a masonry-like effect without having to load any additional javascript.</p>
