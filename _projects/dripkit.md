blurb: A code overhaul for a coffee startup.
brief: |
  Dripkit had a strong brand and a loyal following, but their site was built out in a way that was hard for their team to make changes to their own site, which also needed some structural changes to cope with the launch of new products.
solution: |
  With <a href="http://www.altanddot.com/">Alt & Dot</a>, we iterated on Dripkit's brand to standardize their design language, convert their theme into reuseable sections and implement new features to improve conversion.

  <h3 class="subheading">Personalized Recommendations</h3>
  <p>With the introduction of multiple coffee variations, we introduced a short quiz for customers to be able to identify which coffee would best fit their tastes, improving customer satisfaction. A quiz like this creates the potential for segmenting customers and targeted promotions to better match customer interests.</p>
