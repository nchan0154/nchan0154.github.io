blurb: Design your own custom table.

brief: |
  Rooted wanted to provide a whole host of customization options to their customers, but Shopify has a strict 100 variant limit for each product, as well as limited capabilities for organizing such options.
solution: |
  As a part of <a href="https://altanddot.com">Alt & Dot</a>, we created a custom purchasing experience that organized potential table options into logical categories. Upon selecting a table option, the viewer would generate a new image with the selected options that can be viewed from 4 angles. When a table is completed, the generated table is saved to Shopify with a unique URL, allowing customers to share and revise tables at any time.
