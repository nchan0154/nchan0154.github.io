blurb: Increasing sales through custom Shopify features.

solution: |
  As a part of <a href="http://www.altanddot.com/">Alt & Dot</a>, I implemented several key features that allowed the client to increase sales, including one-click custom product upsells in order to promote products that complimented each other. I also used Vue.js in order to build a quiz to determine the best kind of mattress for the customer depending on their sleeping habits, as well as a product comparison tool that would allow the customer to compare Luma Sleep products to their competitors.
