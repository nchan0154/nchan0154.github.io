brief: | 
  <p>Steven Holl had recently established a new foundation in order to promote his various side projects, including 32BNY, a digital publication; 'T' Space, an art gallery and the firm's extensive model and watercolor archive.</p>
solution: |
  <p>Rather than reproducing all the information on each projectâ€™s individual website, I worked with Steven himself to design a simple landing page which provided a brief introduction to each project. I developed the branding in a way that complimented the existing firm/project branding, incorporating the strict grids and blue from Steven Holl Architects and the image link styling of 32BNY. I also integrated Stripe in order to provide potential donors with an easier way to pay.</p>

    <p>I built the theme in a way that would properly utilize Squarespace's built in customization options, allowing future users to easily make visual tweaks to the layout. Each one of the projects is represented by a custom Collection type, with custom fields that allow for a seamless editing experience. What happens if we want to add more than three projects? No problem! I accounted for this by utilizing flexbox and adding a customization option to toggle the flex basis, so that any number of grid items look nice and balanced.</p>
