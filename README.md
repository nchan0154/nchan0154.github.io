Hi! This is the repository for [my portfolio](https://www.nicchan.me), a Jekyll based site with an image gallery and a blog. Feel free to use it as a reference. You can run this in development mode with `jekyll serve --config _config.dev.yml`

Shoutout to [Alex Pate](https://github.com/alexpate/alexpate.uk), whose own portfolio repo was a great help in learning how to structure my own.
